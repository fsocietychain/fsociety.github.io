## Donation Web

Web created to track donations to an FSC address. It has these features:

- Reads data from a file to use it as a donation total. This is done to avoid constant read requests to the block explorer.
- Displays a percentage bar of what has been donated.
- Responsive web.
- A button copies to the clipboard the address to donate.
- Updated every 120sg

With MIT license and can be modified and used as you want in the project you want. 

The code is not very refined and any suggestions for improvement would be appreciated.
